pySymmPol Documentation
=======================

``PySymmPol`` is a Python package designed for efficient manipulation of
symmetric polynomials. It provides functionalities for working with
various types of symmetric polynomials, including elementary,
homogeneous, monomial symmetric, (skew-) Schur, and Hall-Littlewood
polynomials. In addition to polynomial operations, ``PySymmPol`` offers
tools to explore key properties of integer partitions and Young
diagrams, such as transposition, Frobenius coordinates, characters of
symmetric groups and others.
